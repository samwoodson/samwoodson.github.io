- Rails with a SQLite database
- jQuery for search autocomplete and infinite scroll
- IMDB API for seeding top 250 movies of all time
- CarrierWave/MiniMagick for users to upload movie posters

Rails powers this movie site where users can sign up to submit movies and leave reviews. Users can search for any combination of movie title, director or length. An administrator can login to delete content and has user account control as well.
