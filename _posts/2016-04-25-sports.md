- Sinatra framework using a SQLite database
- Reddit, Twitter and Youtube API's for relevant content
- ESPN Scraper for sports scores

A sports news aggregator built with the minimalist Sinatra framework. Content is gathered using the Reddit API for top rated posts and comments in any corresponding subreddit, the Twitter API for top tweets and the Youtube API for top videos. Tweets and videos are embedded within the page, and users can upvote any content as well as view posts sorted by total votes. Users also have a personalized dashboard that includes any content they have upvoted themselves. A scraper gathering scores from ESPN in any league are scrolled along the top of the corresponding page.
