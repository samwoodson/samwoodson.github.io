## About

I'm a junior developer from Vancouver that enjoys all aspects of front and backend development. Recently finishing Lighthouse Labs gave me a great overview of working in an agile team environment, mainly building in Rails or Node frameworks. My background involves other team based development as well, in second year of Electrical Engineering at UBC I completed the Project Integration Program which involved working on a team of Electrical and Computer Engineering students in addition to our regular curriculum. I enjoyed all aspects of developing the hardware and software involved in each project, but felt drawn towards programming. 

My part time hobby of online poker soon became too lucrative to resist as a 19 year old however, and I went fulltime nearing the end of my second year at UBC in 2008. I continued to tinker on personal projects in my spare time to keep up to date with the ever changing world of programming, and started taking self guided studying seriously in 2015 aimed mainly at web development. 

As I continue to hone my JavaScript skills by developing UI's in React on various Node backends, I'm also intrigued by Elixir, the functional language that runs on the Erlang VM. This is by no means an exhaustive list of technologies that interest me however, and if your stack involves something totally different I'm very keen to dive into a new framework or even language if we choose to work together.
